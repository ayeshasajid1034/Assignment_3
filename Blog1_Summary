# Guide to Learning and Contribution to the DevOps Field

DevOps is all about automating and streamlining software development and deployment processes. Over the course of this assignment, I’ve learned the importance of collaboration, automation, and infrastructure as code. Below are key contributions and practices that I’ve focused on:

## Key Principles:
- **Automation**: Automating CI/CD pipelines and deployments using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitOps.
- **Collaboration**: Working with cross-functional teams to ensure smooth software delivery.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack to monitor and troubleshoot systems.
