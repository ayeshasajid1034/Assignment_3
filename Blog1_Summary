# GitOps and Kubernetes Autoscaling

## GitOps: The Future of Kubernetes and Cloud-Native Deployments
GitOps is a method that uses Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application code. It automates deployments and ensures consistent, auditable, and secure deployment practices.

## Kubernetes Autoscaling
Kubernetes Autoscaling optimizes resource management by adjusting the number of Pods and nodes based on application demand. It helps improve performance and minimize costs.

### Types of Autoscalers:
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** (HPA)
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler** (VPA)
- **Cluster Autoscaler**
